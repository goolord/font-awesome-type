# Font Awesome Type

This package contains a simple but comprehensive enumeration of all [Font
Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) icon classes as a data type. A library can use
this data type and the conversion to CSS class strings to provide a safer
interface for referencing Font Awesome icons than using strings alone.
